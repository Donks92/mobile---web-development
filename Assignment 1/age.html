  <!--General Notes:
    // Write a function that asks the user for his age and displays all the years he has
    reached from 1 to his age
    // Prompt them to enter their age, then once you have it tell the machine to list all numbers between 1 and that number
    //The <var> element in HTML defines a text as a variable and can be used to define variables of a mathematical expression or variables of a piece of code. Note: The <var> element supports all global attributes and event attributes.
    // The parseInt function converts its first argument to a string, parses that string, then returns an integer or NaN . If not NaN ,the return value will be the integer that is the first argument taken as a number in the specified radix.
    // this is a for loop for (var i = 1; i <= age; i++) it tells you to start at 1 and then that i should equal age, setting boundaries and to add a list of numbers between, increasing by an interval of 1
    // The numbersList variable refers to unordered list (<ul>). The innerHTML property allows you to access or modify its HTML content as a string, by using "" you are saying, clear the list or leave it blank
    //  var listItem = document.createElement("li"); this is a function to create an unordered list
    // The document.createElement("li") function creates a new <li> element in memory, it take the age inputted, then reffers to the loop to update the lsit accordingly
    // Text context is what will be displayed in the list
    //  numbersList.appendChild(listItem) is the used to call the listItem document to be displayed on the page
    // you add all of the code that drives the functionality to the head, the the content to the body
